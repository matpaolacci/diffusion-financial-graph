# Synthetic Generation of Financial Transaction Graphs Using Diffusion Models for Anti-Money Laundering

First off, install Miniconda, move to the project directory, and then run the following command:

```bash
conda env create --prefix ./.conda -f environment.yml
```
Then open the [Notebook](notebook.ipynb) and run it.

The notebook was developed using Visual Studio Code, so some plots may not render correctly in other environments (e.g., Google Colab) due to differences in how interactive output is handled.
